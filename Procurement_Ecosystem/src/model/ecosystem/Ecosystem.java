/**
 * Ecosystem serves as the centralized data container and core context of the procurement system.
 * <p>
 * It maintains a list of all {@link Network} instances and acts as the root of the system hierarchy.
 * Each {@code Network} may contain multiple enterprises and organizations, forming the structure of the entire ecosystem.
 * <p>
 * This class is implemented as a Singleton using the Bill Pugh Singleton pattern to ensure that
 * only one instance of the Ecosystem exists throughout the application lifecycle.
 *
 * <h3>Design Rationale:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The Singleton pattern guarantees centralized control and consistent access to system-wide data.</li>
 *   <li>The use of a static inner holder class ensures lazy initialization and thread safety without explicit synchronization.</li>
 *   <li>All methods such as {@code addNetwork()} are declared as instance methods
 *       to preserve the integrity of the Singleton designâ€”ensuring that all operations go through the single shared instance.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Usage Example:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Ecosystem ecosystem = Ecosystem.getInstance();
 * Network network = new Network("Taiwan");
 * ecosystem.addNetwork(network);
 * }</pre>
