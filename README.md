## Overview

This project simulates an enterprise procurement and vendor management system, covering the complete workflow from purchase request (PR) initiation to quotation handling, contract issuance, shipping, and final delivery confirmation.
It models real-world interactions across multiple organizations (Google, TSMC, Samsung, FedEx) and departments, aiming to streamline procurement processes with robust logic and UI/UX enhancements.

> Note: This project uses Mermaid.js diagrams. GitHub currently does not natively render Mermaid syntax. For the best viewing experience, use a compatible Markdown viewer such as VSCode with Mermaid Preview.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Java Swing: Built the desktop application‚Äôs user interface (UI) for a responsive and modular frontend.
- MVC Architecture:
    - Model: Business entities and system objects (e.g., PurchaseRequest, Quotation, Shipment).
    - View: Java Swing UI components organized by functional modules.
    - Coordinates UI actions and invokes service layer logic. Utilizes DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to encapsulate structured data transfer between layers, ensuring clean separation and reducing coupling.
    - Service Layer: Encapsulates business rules, workflow validation, and status management, keeping the controller slim and maintainable.
- Mermaid.js: Used to create flowcharts and process diagrams in Markdown for easy visualization of system workflows.
- PlantUML: Created detailed class diagrams, relationship mappings, and structural overviews during system design.
- Git: Managed version control with branching strategies (feature branches, release branch).
- Linear: Managed task tracking, workflow planning, and project milestones.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights and Challenges

The core of this project was designing a procurement ecosystem where multiple enterprises (e.g., Google, TSMC, FedEx) could interact without tightly coupling their operations.

### Key challenges and highlights include:

- Ecosystem Separation:
    - Carefully designed the system to ensure that each network (enterprise entity) operates independently.
      Changes or workflows within one enterprise would not affect the state or data of another, preserving modularity and avoiding cross-contamination between organizations.

- Approval Workflow Design: Developed a robust multi-step approval mechanism that mirrors real-world business processes:

    - Every action was conditional on the successful completion of the previous step (e.g., RFQ issuance ‚ûî Quotation ‚ûî Internal Procurement Review ‚ûî Finance Budget Approval ‚ûî PO Issuance ‚ûî Shipment ‚ûî Delivery Confirmation).
    - Workflow status transitions were managed carefully to maintain a clear audit trail and ensure accountability at each stage.

- Flow-Based System:
    - Emphasized a true flow-driven system where each transaction, approval, and shipment is tightly linked in sequence.
      Every process in the system is base on the previous step, ensuring business rule integrity and creating a real-world-like procurement experience.

## Business Workflow

### Purchase Request (PR) Approval

```mermaid
flowchart LR
Employee["Any Employee"] -->|Submit PR| Procurement
Procurement -->|1. Review PR| Decision
Decision -->|"Hardware-related?"| IT
Decision -->|"Non-Hardware"| Finance

    IT -->|2. Approve Technical Specs| Procurement
    Procurement -->|3. RFQ and Quotation Submission| Finance
    Finance -->|4. Final Budget Approval| Procurement
```

---

### Request for Quotation (RFQ) & Vendor Quotation

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Procurement_Specialist["Procurement Specialist (Google)"] -->|1. Issue RFQ| Sales_Manager["Sales Manager (TSMC)"]
    Sales_Manager -->|2. Review RFQ and Submit Quotation| Procurement_Specialist
    Procurement_Specialist -->|3. Internal Review| Procurement_Review["Procurement Internal Review"]
    Procurement_Review -->|4. Forward to Finance| Finance_Analyst["Finance Analyst (Google)"]
    Finance_Analyst -->|5. Budget Approval| Procurement_Specialist
    Procurement_Specialist -->|6. Initiate Final PO| Sales_Manager
```

PO transmission is permitted only after Finance finalizes the budget.

#### In multi-vendor scenarios:

```

### Shipment & Delivery

The delivery workflow handles the shipment process from vendor to Google‚Äôs warehouse, ensuring streamlined delivery confirmation and procurement closure.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    %% Google
    Procurement_Specialist["Procurement Specialist (Google)"] -->|1. Send PO| Sales_Manager["Sales Manager (TSMC)"]

    %% TSMC to FedEx
    Sales_Manager -->|2. Request Shipment| Shipping_Coordinator["Shipping Coordinator (FedEx)"]

    %% FedEx to Google
    Shipping_Coordinator -->|3. Ship Goods + Tracking Info| Warehouse_Specialist["Warehouse Specialist (Google)"]

    %% Google Internal Confirmation
    Warehouse_Specialist -->|4. Confirm Delivery & Condition & Close PR| Procurement_Specialist
```

#### Key System Notes

- PO Lifecycle: Once created and sent, the PO remains unchanged; there is no separate status management for the PO object.
- Shipment Lifecycle: The Shipment progresses from PLACED ‚ûî IN_TRANSIT ‚ûî DELIVERED, with the final delivery confirmation triggered by Google‚Äôs Warehouse Specialist.
- Delivery Confirmation: Google‚Äôs Warehouse Specialist confirms delivery, and the system automatically completes the associated PurchaseRequest (PR).

#### Step-by-Step Workflow

|**Step**|**Actor**|**Action**|**System Behavior**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Procurement Specialist (Google)|Sends the approved Purchase Order (PO) to the vendor (e.g., ASUS, TSMC).|PO is created and sent; no further status tracking on PO itself.|
|2|Sales Manager (Vendor)|Receives the PO and initiates a Delivery Request to FedEx. Simultaneously creates a Shipment object with receiver, item list, quantity, and an auto-generated tracking number.|Shipment status set to PLACED.|
|3|Shipping Coordinator (FedEx)|Reviews the Delivery Request, fills in shipment details (shipment date, expected arrival date = current date + 5 days), and accepts the request.|Shipment status updated to IN_TRANSIT; DeliveryRequest marked as ACCEPTED.|
|4|System|Updates Google‚Äôs internal UI. The Warehouse Specialist can view the shipment record with status IN_TRANSIT.|
|5|Warehouse Specialist (Google)|Upon physical receipt of the goods, clicks **‚ÄúConfirm Delivery‚Äù** in the system to acknowledge successful receipt.|Shipment status updated to DELIVERED; the associated PurchaseRequest (PR) is automatically marked as COMPLETED.|
